# Javascript Presentation for ITP 104 @ USC

This is a mini-lecture that I gave at my Web Development Class at USC about the current state of the Web Development Field. 
I built the presentation as a React Application. 

# Installation and Running

There are a few commands that you will need in order to run this with ease. For those who are not new to React or Javascript, a simple run
a simple use of Yarn should do the trick in getting this application started! 

If you are new to this, no worries! Here is a step by step guide on how to get this working on your local environment:

If you do not have homebrew, go here: https://brew.sh

Then after that, type in

	brew install node

Then wait for a little bit on your computer to install node. Once that is finished, let's make sure that things are working as they should be! Type:

	npm --version

And if there are no errors that are returned, then you are all set to continue! Here is a link to help you troubleshoot: https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html

And while you are at it, make sure that you have a functional version of Git installed:

	git --version

If you dont have git installed (ie, an error happened), no worries! Just type in this command and try again... you most likely just didnt 
have it installed!

	brew install git

After this, you are almost there! Stay in your terminal and change directories to whichever folder you wish to have this presentation run. 

Copy and paste this into your Command Line:

	git pull https://github.com/benmorehouse/javascriptPresentation.git

This should then put my entire github repository into your computer so that you are able to work with the code on your local enviroment.

To just start and be able to use the web app, type in

	npm start

And it should build and start the application for you and display it automatically in your preferred window! 

# That's all!
